Using HTML, CSS and JS to create the project from the Free Code Camp, adding my twist of course.

I used HTML to create the basics of the page as well as a form.
I used CSS to style the page.
I used CSS Flexbox to manipulate how the elements look on the page.
I used JS to write a small script that opens a picture on the page when you click an item on the list, as well as closing the picture when you click on it.
I used CSS Grid to create a very basic picture gallery.
